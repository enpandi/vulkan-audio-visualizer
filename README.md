# Vulkan audio visualizer

runs a desktop application which listens to audio data from the default microphone. uses Goertzel algorithm to compute spectrum intensities. outputs pretty shapes and colors via Vulkan.

TODO clean up code, document better, check if it builds (if the latest commit doesn't build, one of the older commits should build?)

(system default microphone must be selected before program startup)
